# React + TypeScript + Vite

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm run dev`


As the provided apis are throwing cors error, I have implemented the UI using dummy json file with respect to the given types of the resultant object.

Login and Register Route are defined in

`/login`
`/register`


Details Route or Transaction list route is defined on

`/details`

Used context to store the user data after login or after checking if user is logged in

`_checkCurrentUser` is commented in `App.tsx` file as of now to navigate to further details page, otherwise if user is not logged in, it will redirect to login page
